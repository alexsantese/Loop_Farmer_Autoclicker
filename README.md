# Loop_Farmer_Autoclicker

A simple autoclicker that uses Pillow and numpy to make an autoclicker for the game Loop Farmer on crazygames.io. 
The bot can autoupgrade itself and will use the level-based upgrades as well as reset after a certain period of time to get higher bonuses. 

The main purpose of the bot was to learn about using pyautogui and Pillow/numpy to turn images into arrays of pixels and then iterate through
those pixels to look for specific values.
